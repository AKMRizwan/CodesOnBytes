Phase 1 : tasks 1 & 2
#########:   Task 1   :########
In task 1 , I have followed the procedure mentioned below
:- I have simply used ".get()" method to call the API .
:- I have checked whether the request was successful or not.
:- I have created columns .
:- I have filtered the columns.
:- I have finally saved the data in CSV file.
#######:   Task 2   :#########
In task 2 , the steps I have followed are as mentioned below 
:- In this task first step was to load the datasheet.
:- I have checked the number of rows and columns.
:- Checked the data types of first five rows and columns.
:- Checked the missing values however there were no missing values.
:- Checked for the duplicate values however there were no duplicate values.
:- Applied IQR method to detect outliers and found some.
:- Removed the outliers.
:- Saved the clean data into a CSV file.
Phase 2 : task 3 & 4
#######:   Task 3   :#########
In task 3 , the steps I have follewed are as follows
:- At first I have analyzed the data.
:- Checked for missing values.
:- Checked for duplicated values.
:- Checked for outliers with IQR method.
:- After analyzing the data I have saved the cleaned data into a new CSV file.
:- And then I have moved to the main task i.e plotting the Graphs.
:- I plotted 9 different graphs which are bar ,, box , count , heat , histogram , line , pie , scattered and violin graph.
########:    Task 4    :#########
In task 4 , the steps I have followed are as follows
:- At first I have loaded the dataset both test and train dataset.
:- And then i have analyzed the both datasets .
:- And after analyzing the both datasets I have saved them into a new CSV file.
:- And then I have loaded the cleaned datasets both train and test for Regression model.
:- In creating the Regression model at first I have splitted the data into dependent and independent variables.
:- After that I have visualized the data in the scattered plot with regression line having train data as Blue dots and predicted data as Red dots that can be found in the repository named as Regression_model.png .
######:   FINAL DETAILES    :######
:- All the required data can be found in the repository from Task-1 to task-4 
:- The code I have written for compliting this Internship can be found in the Text documents named as Source_code.
:- All the datasets are there.
:- All the cleaned datasets are there.
:- All the task's python files are there.
:- All the graphs are there.
